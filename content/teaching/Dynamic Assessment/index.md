summary: Academics with teaching responsibility allocate a significant time to the preparation of problems, answers, and grading. Moreover, creating an informative assessment and encouraging students to collaborate, but submit their works is a concern of most instructors. On the other hand, students need examples and practice tests to learn, and the more they practice the more successful they are. R/exam Package can be used to convert the static questions into dynamic questions and then by a random selection of these dynamic questions, the program creates dynamic quizzes, tests and assignments to address these issues. The assessment designer can choose the type of problems such as single choice, multiple-choice, fill in the blank, short and long answers. The solutions are created automatically, and grading is done by the program as well. An instructor can use this method for both in-class and online courses since the output can be a PDF, HTML or zipped files ready to be imported into different online learning systems.
