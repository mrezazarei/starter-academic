**I have lived in several countries and have been a  multidisciplinary student in different schools. Now, I am a researcher, an engineer, a statistician, an economist, and more importantly, a humble teacher. Every course, teacher, class, program, and culture in my life had positive and negative impacts. What I believe is to use my good experiences to improve my teaching and learn from the bad experiences to become a life changer like great teachers who made a significant impact on my academic achievements. I see teaching as caring and supporting students to reach their goals. We are surrounded by distractions such as cellphones, social media, politics, emotions, and the environment, to say a few. Learning occurs when we pay attention, get engaged and are motivated. Students and their teachers should have a healthy, productive, and professional relationship. Efficient teaching happens in a safe space that accommodates students in a calm, peaceful, positive learning environment. A teacher incorporating modeling, active learning, technology, and formative assessment in a dynamic, universal course design that is equity-oriented, centered on youth interest and socially connected can engage, motivate, and attract students to learn more effectively.**

*Using different online teaching technologies and developing reciprocity//cooperation among students is a significant part of my teaching.* During lecturing, I incorporate formative assessment using teaching apps (e.g., Plickers, Kahoot, etc.). I assess the learning performance of the students during the lecture. In case of confusion, students ask their questions, I provide more explanations, and I move on after reaching a reasonable performance rate. Using technology, students also play games in the class and compete individually and as a group. The overall learning performance is evaluated by mastery-based grading in assignments. I use online platforms (VoiceThread) to present projects. This platform provides more tools (talk, text, video, or voice call) to answer the problems and is a more engaging learning environment. Moreover, students choose the way to communicate and have more chances to learn from each other. I provide the objectives, expectations, rules, and policies to ensure a culture of mutual respect and a safe space.

*Active learning and practical applications are engaging and motivating.* Covering definitions, I provide at least three different meanings for the same subject. I ask for a volunteer to read them. Students in small groups then find the common synonym words used in these definitions and make a simple definition of the subject in their terms and share it with others. When I am teaching price discrimination, I start by asking, “How do you save money?”.  We share our experiences (e.g., Black Friday, Costco, coupons, etc.) and different methods that retailers incentivize the consumers. Then students categorize our experiences into the three defined forms of price discrimination in small groups. After that, we move on to the theories and clarify them using mathematical examples with practical applications. Students learn essential marketing methods, transferable skills, and real-life money saving strategies. 

*Students’ feedback and critical reflections are significant parts of a universal course design, focusing on students’ equity and interest.* Each semester, I motivate students utilizing extra points to submit evaluation surveys during and at the end of the semester to incorporate their opinion into my teaching. For example, I have realized how much providing more examples and practice tests are in demand. Providing a wide variety of questions with the same level of difficulty and the same learning objective is difficult and costly. Therefore, I use my programming knowledge and available resources (e.g., Rexam package) to change static questions to dynamic questions. Using this method, questions and answers that can be auto-graded are available for students without any extra cost. This approach provides the ability to customize queries and graphs according to students’ needs with disabilities. 

*I set all the expectations and policies upfront and do whatever in my power to accommodate my students and provide a safe space.* As a teacher, I leave my biases on an abandoned island to just serve. I accept students as they are and reach the disability, veteran, LGBT+, and other centers to understand their needs better and accommodate them. I have been a learner and will be a teacher who learns from colleagues, experts, and pioneers in teaching. I have used new technologies and will not stop bringing new ones in my class. I have used traditional grading and will not hesitate to use mastery-based grading when appropriate. I KNOW THAT I AM NOT THE BEST TEACHER, BUT I NEVER GIVE UP BECOMING A BETTER ONE.
