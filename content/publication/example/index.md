abstract: The Community Rating System (CRS) of The National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) incentivizes local governments to engage in floodplain management activities beyond the minimum requirements of the NFIP, offering credits for activities that promote flood risk awareness, purchase of insurance, and flood hazard mitigation. The CRS is innovative in that it promotes flood risk management by offering discounts on flood insurance for all insurance holders in participating communities, where the discount depends upon the number of credit points earned. Local government officials and/or floodplain managers can utilize the CRS manual to design, implement, and document creditable activities, including public information provisions, flood risk mapping, higher regulatory standards, flood risk mitigation, and flood warning and response programs. Since its inception in 1990, however, the CRS has undergone multiple changes that render the program difficult to study. In addition, the CRS has many idiosyncratic provisions that require a detailed understanding. For example, while communities enjoy a good deal of latitude in selection of CRS activities, some elements are required to initiate CRS, and others are required to move from one class level to another. Also, many creditable activities have “adjustment factors” that may limit a community’s ability to attain points. Given this program complexity and structural change, we render a detailed outline of the CRS program since its inception, clearly describing how the program has changed and exploring ways to incorporate these complexities in analysis of creditable activities and their impact on CRS communities. We present findings regarding which communities participate in CRS, which flood risk mitigation activities are chosen, and explore how effective these efforts are in reducing flood damage and fatalities.
